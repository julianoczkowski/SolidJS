## User Rule 1: Mandatory Todo List Creation & Task Management

<details>
<summary>Click to expand and copy User Rule 1</summary>

```
CRITICAL: Always create a comprehensive todo list using the todo_write tool before starting ANY development task.

Requirements:
- BEFORE any development work: Create detailed todo list using `todo_write` tool
- Break down complex tasks into specific, actionable items
- Update status in real-time as you work (mark in_progress/completed)
- Focus on one task at a time - Mark only one todo as "in_progress" at any given moment
- Never skip this step - todo lists are mandatory for all development tasks

Every Task Must Follow:
1. üìù CREATE TODO LIST (using todo_write tool) - NEVER SKIP
2. üéØ ANALYZE requirements against project standards
3. üíª IMPLEMENT using established patterns and best practices
4. üîç REVIEW code for quality and consistency
5. ‚úÖ MARK TODOS COMPLETE when finished
```
